# Vertical-Lift-Bridge-Simulation

A **computer graphics mini project** that simulates a vertical lift bridge using **OpenGL and C++**.  
This simulation visually demonstrates how a vertical lift bridge operates — where the central span is raised and lowered to allow ships to pass — while showcasing the use of transformations, animations, and lighting effects in computer graphics.

## 🧠 About the Project
* The **Vertical Lift Bridge Simulation** visually represents a realistic bridge-lifting    mechanism.  
* It was developed as a **mini project for Computer Graphics** to demonstrate:
- 3D object rendering using OpenGL primitives  
- Smooth animations using transformations  
- Day and night mode transitions using lighting effects  
- Interactive controls through keyboard input  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Animated vertical lift bridge movement  
- Realistic day and night transitions  
- Dynamic scene with water, ship, and bridge visuals  
- Smooth motion and lighting control  
- Intro screen and main simulation screen
